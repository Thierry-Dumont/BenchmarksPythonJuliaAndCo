There are some problems with nowadays version of Numba (0.51.1 / 2020/08):

-FeStiff:  adeprecation warning, and a warning concerning dot.

-MicroBenchMarks: cannot parallelize lapl1d_2 in main_lapl_1d.py

-Sparse: build3.py has a problem with np.empty

-Weno: some warnings.

all this needs modifications.
