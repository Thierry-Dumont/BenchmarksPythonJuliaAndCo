To run the code, just type:
```
./script
```
If you type:
```
./script-m
```
You will be able to see how Julia manages memory, but you will
slowdown the code!

### Note:

If you want to test the _pushed_ method to create matrices, have a
look at the begining of main.jl.

With the  _pushed_ method, one does not need to precompute array
sizes, put the method is much slower.
