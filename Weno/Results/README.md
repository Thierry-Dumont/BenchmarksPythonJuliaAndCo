Just run:

```
./Look.py
```
This will give you the computing time divided by C++ computing time.

Before, you must have run the benchmark in all directories
(C++,Ju,Py and Numba, Fortran). 

If you do not run all the benchmarks (or if you add one), juste modify the list
"directories to explore" in Look.py
