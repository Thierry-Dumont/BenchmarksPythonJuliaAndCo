#### This small SageMath script is supposed to show how computer algebra can help implementing finite elements (this a very simple example!). 

You need [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) to run this snippet,


* **Stiff.ipynb:**  is a SageMath _notebook_. To launch it:
```
>sage -n jupyter
```
and let you conduct by Jupyter and SageMath. 

Note that if you click on Stiff.ipynb here,
Github will display the results (as stored in the notebook).


##### Note: ####
If you want to learn _SageMath_, you can read the book _Mathematical Computation
with Sage_ (which now is available in French, English and German), and
for which freely available pdf files are [downloadable 
here](https://members.loria.fr/PZimmermann/sagebook/english.html) and [there](http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/).
