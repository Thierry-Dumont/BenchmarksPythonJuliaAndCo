#### These small SageMath scripts are supposed to show how computer algebra can help implementing finite elements (this a very simple example!). 

You need [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) to run these snippets,
which both perform the same computation:

* **Stiff.ipynb:** this is a SageMath _notebook_. To launch it:
```
>sage -n jupyter
```
and let you conduct by Jupyter.

* **stiff.sage:** a command line script; to run it:
```
>sage
sage: load("stiff.sage")
```


The _notebook_ may be more pedagogical than the script.

##### Note: ####
If you want to learn _SageMath_, you can read the book _Mathematical Computation
with Sage_ (which now is available in French, English and German), and
for which freely available pdf files are [downloadable 
here](https://members.loria.fr/PZimmermann/sagebook/english.html) and [there](http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/).
