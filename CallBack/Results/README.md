Just run:

```
./Look.py
```
This will give you the computing time divided by C++-Functor computing time.

Before, you must have run the benchmark in all directories
(C++-Functor, C++-lambda, Ju, Py and Numba).

If you do not run all the benchmarks (or if you add one), juste modify the list
"directories to explore" in Look.py
