We present some very small tests, wich are common pieces of _real_
software:

* linear combinations of vectors.

* dot products of vectors

* apply finite differences (order 2) laplacian in dimension 1.

* apply finite differences (order 2) laplacian in dimension 2.

#####  Problems: 

something is wrong in main_ddot.*
